                        unique risks, especially concerning the clients' property. A Liability policy can cover other's
                        property while it is in your care or custody. So if one of your employees accidentally destroys
                        a sprinkler system and a client sues for replacement or repair expenses, your policy could cover
                        the repair and legal fees associated with the covered claim.</p></div>

                        injury or property damage, general liability insurance would cover the damages and well as the
                        defense costs. To illustrate, suppose you installed new wiring in a client’s establishment,
                        which shorts, causes a fire, and results in extensive damage to the client’s property. But if
                        you had general liability as part of your electrician insurance package, you would be covered
                        for damages in accordance with your policy terms. Further, if you’re an electrical contractor
                        working on a client’s site, your client may require you to have general liability insurance.</p>

                        general liability policy. General liability offers protection from financial burden as a result
                        of bodily injury or property damage that can occur during the painting contractor’s job. For
                        example, if they have an employee who accidentally knocks over a paint can that ruins a piece of
                        furniture not properly protected with a drop cloth, the homeowner can sue the painting
                        contractor’s business. General liability offers financial protection for that type of
                        occurrence.</p></div>
